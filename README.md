# Dataset
This report draw on data from a randomized trial testing whether a modified milk formula (f75) improves outcomes for children with severe acute malnutrition (first 6-months of data from year-long study).
The primary publication of this data: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30807589/

## Organization
Team members are expected to adhere to the organizational structure outlined. Code files should be well-named and include initials of the coder; code is to be housed in the code folder. Output should be housed in the output folder. Final report will be loaded into the report folder.

## Roles
__Eleane__ is responsible for creating Table 1. This table should compare baseline characteristics between the standard formula (F75) and the isocaloric modified F75 (m75) arm.
__Sarina__ is responsible for creating a boxplot that shows changes in MUAC from baseline to endlines across arms.
__Mele__ is responsible for creating Table 2. This table contains information for a linear regression model that predicts change in MUAC by arm.

## Running the Code
`make ` in the terminal will generate the report

## Customization
A config file will be created with sex (M or F) of the child as the parameter for customization. The output file will specify which sex is being reported on.
To customize, use terminal:
  `export R_CONFIG_ACTIVE=` and set to male, female, or default. This will modify the boxplot and regression table.
  To go between different subsets, `make clean` to get an updated report.
